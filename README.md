# Frog-Wishlist

## Overview
This is an app that allows a user to keep track what frogs they have and frogs that they find and want. This can become very useful for someone in this hobby to keep track of what animals they come across that they want to purchase later as they can be expensive.

## Features
As of now most of the features are broken and bugged not allowing them to work properly. 

## For the future 
In the future this app will be able to be used by multiple users and with more useful features such as adding a breeder to animals as some are only able to be purchased from certain breeders. This will be helpful so you don't forget where you can find them later. More user friendly styling and db function is also necessary.
